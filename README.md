# GAME THEORETIC LIBRARY

This library contains a domain-independent framework for modeling normal-form and extensive-form games,
and offers a unique collection of algorithms for solving these games.

## MCCR (Monte Carlo Continual Resolving)

Most important files are:

    CRAlgorithm
    OOSAlgorithm
    OOSAlgorithmData
    CRExperiments

To reproduce experiments you will need to also install python with fairly standard dependencies (numpy, pandas, matplotlib). Experiments are computationally heavy and were distributed on a cluster.

Some approximate stats:

    IIGS-5  | public states: 243     memory: 0.5GB    t/1M root iters: 6      t/ 10M in gadget = 4h
    LD 116  | public states: 2176    memory: <1GB     t/1M root iters: 3.4    t/ 10M in gadget = 21h
    GP 3322 | public states: 1046    memory: <0.2GB   t/1M root iters: 5      t/ 10M in gadget = 14.5h

There are scripts which generate commands that each node in the cluster should independetly process, the results then need to be concatenated.

Look at `mccr_experiments/run_all.sh` for more details.

## Compile / package / run

Add cplex static libraries to java library path (for example in .bashrc).
Update path appropriately:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:`pwd`/libs/cplex"

Then run in root of the project (this launches tests as well):

    mvn package

You can launch some class with

    cd target
    java -cp gtlibrary.jar cz.agents.gtlibrary.algorithms.runner.SMJournalExperiments

## Integration with other projects:

package cz/agents/gtlibrary/algorithms/sequenceform/refinements/quasiperfect contains several files from GTF framework by Troels Bjerre Sorensen (http://www.itu.dk/people/trbj/gtf.html)
