Game theory is a \emph{descriptive} theory defining the conditions for the strategies of rational agents to form an equilibrium. From the \emph{prescriptive} viewpoint, game theory generally fails (e.g., when multiple Nash equilibria exist) and can only suggest which strategies the agents should follow. Extensive-form general-sum games have a plethora of solution concepts, each posing specific assumptions about the players. Unfortunately, there is no comparison of the effectiveness of the solution-concept strategies from the perspective that would serve as a guideline for selecting the right algorithm for a given domain. We provide this comparison and evaluate the effectiveness of strategies prescribed by several solution concepts in practice against various opponents. Moreover, we also consider strategies from algorithms such as Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that are often used in domain-specific cases, although they are not guaranteed to converge to any game-theoretical solution concept. Our results show that (1) CFR strategies perform typically the best, (2) the effectiveness of the Nash equilibrium and its refinements is closely related to the correlation between the utilities of players, and (3) that the strong assumptions about the opponent in Stackelberg equilibrium typically cause ineffective strategies when these assumptions do not hold.
